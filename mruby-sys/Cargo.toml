# Disable doctests because the C headers for mruby have doc strings containing
# indented ruby code blocks. bindgen pulls these doc strings into `src/ffi.rs`.
# cargo test attempts to run these as Rust doctests which fails to parse. It is
# not possible to annotate these doctests with `ignore` because you can only add
# attributes to fenced code blocks.
